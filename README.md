## Why process with Content Understanding?
- **Simplify and streamline workflows.** Azure AI Content Understanding standardizes the extraction of content, structure, and insights from various content types into a unified process.
- **Simplify field extraction.** Content Understanding's field extraction makes it easier to generate structured output from unstructured content. Define a schema to extract, classify, or generate field values with no complex prompt engineering
- **Enhance accuracy.** Content Understanding employs multiple AI models to analyze and cross-validate information simultaneously, resulting in more accurate and reliable results.

## Content Understanding use cases
- **Automation.** Content Understanding supports automation scenarios by converting unstructured content into structured data, which can be integrated into various workflows and applications. Confidence scores minimize human review and lower costs. For example, automate procurement and payment processes by extracting fields from invoices.
- **Search and retrieval augmented generation (RAG).** Content Understanding enables ingestion of content of any modality into the search index. The structured output representation improves the relevance for RAG scenarios.
- **Analytics and reporting:** Content Understanding's extracted field outputs enhance analytics and reporting, allowing businesses to gain valuable insights, conduct deeper analysis, and make informed decisions based on accurate reports.
